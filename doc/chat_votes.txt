13:34:53  From Jérémy Anger : docker is more trending but ini looks cooler

13:35:46  From dewil : ini, of course

13:50:51  From Jérémy Anger : "pip install ipol" will be awesome
can we disable the archive? (should be off by default)
could we automatically convert ddl files to ipol.py config files?
13:52:47  From Quentin Bammey : can there be some exchange with the online IPOL archives?
13:53:57  From pariasm : I'd like an ipol-demo.sh that sends the images to the server and runs the demo there and sends the output back. How many beers does this require?
13:58:11  From Axel Davy : What happens in case of compilation error (new gcc release + program using -Wall -Werror for example) ? Is it easy for the user to workaround the error.
14:00:57  From Axel Davy : Thank you ! Very interesting
14:01:34  From Boris : Thank you, very fun!
